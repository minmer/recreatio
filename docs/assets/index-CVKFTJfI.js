Data is encrypted with keys derived from user roles.
Without keys, there is no access, even for administrators.`},{q:"Does the server know my password?",a:`No. The password is transformed locally and the server stores only a verifier.
The database never stores H1/H2/H3, only the H4 verifier.`},{q:"Can I use it without an account?",a:"Yes. Public portals (Parish and Cogita) provide open information without login."},{q:"What is secure mode?",a:`Secure mode disables the session secret cache.
Keys are reconstructed per request and discarded immediately.`},{q:"Is there a classic password reset?",a:`No. Account recovery requires a multi-party procedure and audit trail.
This prevents silent resets by third parties.`},{q:"What are account states?",a:`Accounts can be Pending, Active, Locked, Disabled, or Deleted.
State transitions are recorded in the Auth Ledger.`},{q:"What happens after login?",a:`A SessionId and access token are issued.
Tokens never contain encryption keys or sensitive payloads.`},{q:"Are changes audited?",a:`Yes. Key events are recorded in the Auth Ledger.
